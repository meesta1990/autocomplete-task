# Task Autocomplete

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Mocked API call

For the task, I utilized a mock web service accessible at https://mocki.io/fake-json-api.
By inputting a response in the textarea, it generates an API call that will return the response you have configured.
The JSON array I used can be found at ./src/mockedOptions.json.
